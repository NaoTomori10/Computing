REI-LYN POV:


I let out a sigh as I moved on to my next doodle, flipping to an empty space on my worksheet and drawing yet another turtle. My calligraphy and small sketches had already filled almost the whole page in the short time that I have been dying in this classroom, listening to the teacher's voice drone on and on. 

"Okay, class, please take out your phones." 

My ears perked up at those words almost instantly. My heart started beating a little faster. I whipped out my phone quickly, entering Whatsapp to check the picture the teacher sent. While that, I was watching at the corner of my eye, the movements of the person next to me. 

Will he...? 

I needn't have waited a second longer. He got up and dragged his chair beside me. 

"Rei-Lyn, what did cher send?" He shifted closer to me to take a look at my phone. My cheeks started turning red. Oh. God. No. Nonono. Not wanting my heart to go anymore crazier, I focused on the picture that the teacher sent, and tried my hardest to ignore the fact that he was leaning close to me. 

My attention, failing me, drifted from the text to him. My eyes looked at his, the concentration in his eyes, his round glasses reflecting light, it was as if he was giving off a glow. Like the world wanted all my attention to be directed at him. I hate to say, it worked.

"okay, class, please discuss in your group of fours." 

I was silent as he started the discussion. My gaze lingering on his face. 

"What do you think, Rei-Lyn?" His attention was now directed at me, a small smile on his lips.

"I..." I sat awkwardly, my hands twisted together and I picked at my fingernail nervously. I was so focused on him, I hadn't been listening to what he was saying. His eyebrow raised slightly, lips slowly curling into a small smirk. "Well?" He asks again. 

"What... What did you say again?" Face flushed, i asked him uncomfortably, avoiding his gaze. I waited for him to answer then look away, but he didn't, he merely continued to look at me and patiently explained it again. 
He leaned a little closer towards me, and I instinctively jerked back a bit, afraid that my cheeks would turn redder than it already was. 

"G-Great idea." I stammered, praying that my voice wouldn't give away my feelings for him. I turned my body so i wasn't facing him anymore. The image of him appeared in my brain, again. He's just a friend, right? Rhys is just a friend. 
I desperately cracked a joke, hoping to brush away my embarassment and engage a conversation with Clarisse instead, i regretted it seconds after i said it, though. He tipped his head back lightly and gave out a small chuckle. I couldn't turn my gaze away. Oh god. Why is my heart beating so fast? DAMMIT, i should have just grown my fringe so it covers my entire face and i will never have to feel like this ever again

I really wanna tell him. I do. But will it ruin our friendship? I'm sure he only sees me as a friend.

"Someone was blushin during lessonnn," Tanya teased. I gave her an annoyed look, "I wasn't you little-" I say."Still in denial I see." Tanya interrupts. "Don't worry, you look cute together." 

RHYS POV: 

She looked so uncomfortable just now. Was it her being uncomfortable or...? No. She would never like me. Would she..? Should I confess and get it over with? 

I threw an annoyed look as my friends yelled out, "SIMP." (Not cool, don't say that)

Should I really confess though? Or not? Does she like me back? Ah, I don't know anymore.

I turned my head to catch a glimspe of Rei-Lyn again. Her cute ponytail, her rosy cheeks, her sweet, bright smile - she really was very pretty.

Arghh noo I'm too young for this relationship business. Focusing on my studies is top priority.

I looked at her again. The way she laughed made me smile. She's soo adorable.

Ughh now I'm sure I do have feelings for her but... it could just be a stupid crush, that's all. But the way my heart does a thousand flips when I see her, the way every word she says turns into music, the way her smile seems to make all my worries go away...

Should I tell her? I really want to just blurt out my feelings right now. She'll probably think I'm a freak though haha...

REI-LYN POV:

Do I really like him? Don't I just like him as a friend? I... 

You know what. I'm just gonna watch Netflix. I can worry about other things later.

I picked up the remote control and watched my favourite anime to get thoughts of Rhys out of my head. 

NEXT DAY

REI-LYN POV:
For some reason, I received a text from Rhys today. The text just said, "After school." And the location. Apparently he wanted to meet at the back of the school. Could it be..? No. He would never like me. I didn't tell anyone about the text. After all, he probably wouldn't want me to, and my friends would likely go insane (of happiness). 

When we were released, I excused myself, saying that I had to do some after school activity today. I walked alone to the back of the school. 

I waited for a few minutes. No one came. Was this a prank or..? My eyes scanned my surroundings. 

Finally, I saw a figure rushing towards me. 

"sorry, I was held back." He says, panting.
